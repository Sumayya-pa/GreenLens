# GreenLens
The main objective of this project is to familiarize with machine learning and subsequently apply the knowledge gained in solving a real-world problem. We choose the project    topic chakka-manga classifier. As the name indicates we have to classify jackfruits and mangoes from a given sets of data using machine learning.We work in a team of three. At starting we don't have much knowledge,so we started to watch youtube videos and start coding parallely.
